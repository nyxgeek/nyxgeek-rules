# this script takes a wordlist as input, and creates two files from it: HEAD.out and TAIL.out
# you should then feed those files into hashcat as parts of a combinator attack

# the idea here is to create lists compromised of various subsections of known passwords
# human generated patterns + human generated patterns = more human generated patterns
