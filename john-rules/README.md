# nyxgeek-rules
Custom rules for John the Ripper

INSTALLATION & NOTES
------------------------------------
Copy nyxgeek.conf and all-utf8.conf to your john/run folder. I have separated the giant all-utf8.conf rule into its own rules file since it is nearly 4700 lines. 

Add the following lines to your john.conf file:
```
.include "$JOHN/nyxgeek.conf"
.include "$JOHN/all-utf8.conf"
```


**NOTE:** Depending on what version of John you're using, you may need to specify either "--internal-encoding" or "internal-codepage" parameters, or edit the john.conf file to set the DefaultInternalEncoding.  If these rules aren't working correctly for you try "--internal-encoding=UTF-8" or "--internal-codepage=latin1".
